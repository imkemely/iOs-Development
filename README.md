### App Idea: *EcoSwap*

EcoSwap is a sustainability-focused marketplace where users can exchange items they no longer need instead of buying new ones. The app promotes circular economy by making it easy to trade, swap, or give away items within local communities.

- Location-based browsing for local exchanges
- Carbon footprint calculator showing environmental impact savings
- Community challenges to promote sustainability
- Integrated messaging for negotiating swaps
- Reputation system based on successful exchanges
- Social features to share eco-friendly tips and achievements
